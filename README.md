# Data preparation and loading

1. Download the GEO directory into the folder where all the GIT scripts are located. cd to that directory.
2. Rename the GEO directory as GEOupload if it is not already called as such. 
3. In the command line, type 'bash prepdirs.sh'. this will create the following directories: 

sars042- with files ready for analysis 

sars060- with files ready for analysis

plots- to dump all figures

4. Start R, make sure you have all the required packages described, and run the code chunk by chunk.
